This directory is here for sanity checking.  It contains the pre-computed,
correct values of the canonical and permutation mappings for k from 3 to 7
inclusive. These same values will be built while BLANT is being made in
the Makefile, and then BLANT's output will be compared to these files to
ensure everything is working as expected.
