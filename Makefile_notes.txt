QUESTIONS:
1) If fast-canon-map is changed, then why aren't k=8 data regenerated? Won't the data be incorrect?

2) In some targets (canon_maps/canon_map%.txt, compute-alpha-XXXX), the executable they require is a seperate target elsewhere. 
In other targets (canon_map%.bin), the executable they require is compiled as a part of the recipe, then the target is generated.
Is there a standard that we should use? If so, which?

3) Some targets like fast-canon-map have their respective C file as their requirement
Other targets like makeEHD depend on their respective object O file, which is it's own seperate target that depend on their C file.
Is there any reason for this? Should it be standardized?

4) EHD is explicitly stated to be never used and taking up too much space. Should we remove it?
