// BLANT represents a graphlet using one-half of the adjacency matrix (since we are assuming symmetric, undirected graphs)
// We have a choice of using the upper or lower triangle. We prefer the lower triangle because that's what Jesse uses
// (the graphlet / orbit generation code of Ine Melckenbeeck and friends Ghent university), and they published first.
// NOTE THAT IF YOU CHOOSE UPPER TRIANGLE THEN THE TESTS IN THE MAKEFILE WILL FAIL.
#define LOWER_TRIANGLE	1

// Once we find which canonical graphlet corresponds to a sampled graphlet, we want to know the permutation between the
// two.  We default to the permutation from the canonical to the sampled non-canonical; thus, when we list the nodes
// in the graphlet on BLANT's output, the ordering means that the columns of identical graphlets correspond to an exact
// local alignment between the nodes listed.  Listing them in the other direction doesn't seem to have much use.

// This compile-time constant defines whether or not we perform dynamic on-the-fly construction of the canon_map lookup
// table (stored in _K) rather than reading in canon_map/* files. The default (for now) is 0, meaning read in the files.
